# OTA-Update

This project enables Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates for ESP32 using GitHub as the update source. The ESP32 device periodically checks for a new firmware version from a hosted file on GitHub. If an update is available, it automatically downloads and installs the new firmware.

🚀 Features
✅ WiFi Connectivity – Connects to a specified WiFi network.
✅ Version Checking – Fetches the latest firmware version from GitHub.
✅ OTA Update via HTTP – Downloads and flashes firmware directly from GitHub.
✅ Automatic Restart – Reboots the ESP32 upon successful update.
✅ Scheduled Update Checks – Periodically checks for new firmware updates.

🔧 How It Works
The ESP32 reads the latest firmware version from a firmware_version.txt file hosted on GitHub.

It compares this version with the currently running firmware.

If a newer version is detected, it downloads the updated .bin firmware file.

The ESP32 flashes the new firmware and automatically restarts.

If no update is available, it continues running normally and checks again after a set interval.
